                          Matthew Garcia is an upcoming junior at Gulliver Preparatory in Miami, FL. One of his main interests is music and he is going to be president of the orchestra during this upcoming school year. He also participates in the engineering program, most notably the robotics team, BB-R8ERS. Matthew’s experience in computer science and engineering started his freshman year in the Computer Science Principles class, as well as the VEX Robotics competition. Sophomore year, he continued to study computer science in an Introduction to Java course and as part of the BB-R8ERS. Next year, he will be taking the AP Computer Science course and the AP Computer Science exam. Outside of engineering, he excels in high level classes and was inducted into both the National Honor Society and Mu Alpha Theta, the math honor society.
